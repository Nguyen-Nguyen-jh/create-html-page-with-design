1. What is HTTP?
  - HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's a protocol used for transferring data over the web, 
    specifically between a web server and a web browser.

2. Browser and how they work?
  - Web browsers are software applications that request, retrieve, and display resources from the internet. 
    When you enter a URL, the browser fetches the web page and renders it for viewing. Key components include 
    the user interface (address bar, navigation buttons), the browser engine (coordination of UI and rendering), 
    the rendering engine (displaying HTML and CSS), networking (handling HTTP requests), JavaScript 
    interpreter, and local storage. Browsers use different rendering engines, like Blink for Chrome and Opera, 
    and Gecko for Firefox. They ensure web resources are displayed consistently across platforms while 
    supporting additional functionalities through plugins and extensions.
